# pointer arithmatic
- basically array is a pointer.
- a stores the start address
- `a[2]` is basically `*(a+2)` under the hood.
```c 
int a[2][5]={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,19};
```
- 2D array is a double pointer
	- so doing `**a` is valid on a 2d array, it gives you first element.
	- `**(a+2)` is garbage
	- **irl they follow this formula**
		- `*(*(a+i)+j)`
	- also you can never do `a=a+1;`
	- also the index gets multiplied with the datatype it was declared with.
# print statement always executes from left to right.
```c 
printf("%d %d",10+2,20+4);
```
- here first 20+4 is calculated.
## always see where the * operator is
