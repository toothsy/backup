# DP
- #### go with recursion solution first, dont ever solve wioth dp table.
# ways to identify dp problem
- ### you'll be given a choice of operations that you'll need to choose from.
- ### you'll be told to find either max, min,least, most type of things, rather optimal stuff.
# engineer the recursive solution
- ### for base condition think of the smallest valid input.
- ### keep reducing the input size every recursive call.
