# basics

- # in 12 hours hands meet at 11 times
- # in 24 hours hands meet at 23 times
- ### one division is 
	- ## `30 deg` between any consecutive hours.
	- ## `6 deg` for MINUTE HAND
	- ##  `0.5 deg` for HOUR HAND
# Angle between hands 
  
- ### take the difference between numbers.
- ###  compute the division difference.
- ### then subtract or add the  minute progress`they keep moving between hours you know`
	- ### depends on if the hour hand value is less than min hand then you add
	- ### if greater then you subtract.
## example
- ### angle between hands when time is 10:50 when `min hand equal to hour hand `
	- here angle between hour and minute hand is 0
	- the deflection made by the minute hand is added to 0
	- $$0.5*50$$ 
	- $25$ is the answer
- ### angle between hands when time is 10:55 `min greater than hour`
	- here hour hand at 10   and min hand at 11.
	$$1div*30$$
	- the deflection made by the minute hand is removed to $$55*0.5$$
	- so $30-27.5$ is the answer.

- ### angle between hands when time is 6:15 `min less than hour`
	- here hour hand at 6  and min hand at 3.
	$$3div*30$$
	- the deflection made by the minute hand is added to $$15*0.5$$
	- so $90+7.5$ is the answer.
# when will they meet again?

- ### here the hour hand is thought to be stationary
- ### see in basics `h was 0.5`  right so ill subtract 0.5 from it ot make it `0`
- ### now for the minute hand how far is it from 12?
	- ### then divide it by `5.5` which we got from subtracting 0.5 from 6 to keep things balanced.
## example 
- #### when they meet between 4 and 5
- #### 4 is 4 away from 12, so $30*4$ is numerator
- #### then divide it by 5.5 and thats the answer.
- #### when they meet between 3 and 4
- #### 3 is 3 away from 12, so $30*3$ is numerator
- #### then divide it by 5.5 and thats the answer.
- # here find the nearest 11 multiple and subtract it for the fraction
- ## so for 90  $8\frac{2}{11}$<sup>th</sup> is the answer

- # when do the hour and min hand make 90deg between x and y
- ### here you need to subtract  3 and add 3 from the lower hour say x
- ### then calculate the deflection using 2nd method so get the accurate answer
- ## example
- ### between 7 and 8 when they 90deg
- ### 4 and 10 they should meet  but defelection happens of course
- #### $\frac{120}{5.5}$ gives you the minute at which they make 90 before 8
- #### $\frac{300}{5.5}$ gives you the minute at which they make 90 after 8

- # in 12 hrs they meet 22 times
	- ## at 8,9 they meet only once	
	- ## at 2,3 they meet only once	

# specific times
- ## FOR TIMES LIKE 5:53
- ### FIRST   CALCULATE THE PREVIOUS STUFF TILL 5:50
- ### THEN ADD  $3*degreeOfOneMinute$ TO YOU ANSWER.
- ### sign of degreeOfOneMinute depends on hour comparison, always opposite
- ### where $degreeOfOneMinute=6$

## example 
- # 7:28
	- ## 7,5  difference is 2
	- ## so 60 and since 5 is less then 7 im gonna add the deflection
	- ## deflection is $\frac{28}{2} = 14$
	- ## $60+14-3*degreeOfOneMinute$
	- ## giving me $56$ as answer
- # 7:46
	- ## 7,9  difference is 2
	- ## so 60 and since 7 is less then 9 im gonna sub the deflection
	- ## deflection is $\frac{46}{2} = 23$
	- ## $60-23+1*degreeOfOneMinute$
	- ## giving me $43$ as answer
