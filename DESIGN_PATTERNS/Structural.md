# Structural Design Patterns

-  Structural design patterns are concerned with how classes and objects can be composed, to form larger structures.

- The structural design patterns simplifies the structure by identifying the relationships.

- These patterns focus on, how the classes inherit from each other and how they are composed from other classes.


- There are following 7 types of structural design patterns.

	- Adapter Pattern
    	- Adapting an interface into another according to client expectation.
	- Bridge Pattern
    	- Separating abstraction (interface) from implementation.
    - Composite Pattern
    	- Allowing clients to operate on hierarchy of objects.
    - Decorator Pattern
	    - Adding functionality to an object dynamically.
    - Facade Pattern
	    - Providing an interface to a set of interfaces.
    - Flyweight Pattern
	    - Reusing an object by sharing it.
    - proxy Pattern
		- Representing another object.


# Adapter
- An Adapter Pattern says that just "converts the interface of a class into another interface that a client wants".

- In other words, to provide the interface according to client requirement while using the services of a class with a different interface.
