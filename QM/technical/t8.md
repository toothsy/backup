# comma operator
- it does a series of operation from `left to right`  
- ## they will execute
- it returns  the last operation performed 
```c
int a = 8;
int b = (a++,++a,a++);

```
- here b is  10 and a is 11.
	- notice the bloody post increment

# STORAGE CLASSES  

- ### every variable in c is either of  
	- register 
	- auto => default one 
	- static 
	- extern 
## auto 
- ##### stored in RAM
	- to see the address you must use,  
	`printf(" %p",&a);`
	- `%x` gives you the hex value but it aint complete address, range of `%x` is small
- #### only valid in their scope


## register
- #####  stored in cpu register
	- CAN NOT BE READ BY USERS.  

`NOTE: function prototype must be put before the function call`

## static 
- are not deleted when scope ends.
- stored along with global vars.

## defining and declaring variables
- declaring means telling a compiler a variable exists `int a`
- defining means when ur variable is given memory when program executes.

## extern 
- kept outside ram but in ram. 


# to find the prime number  the best way is to check till the square root of the given number, after that the multiples repeat.
```c
int prime(int n){
	int i=0;
	int m = sqrt(n);
	for(i=0;i<m;i++){
		if(n%i) return 0;
	}
	return 1;
}
```
