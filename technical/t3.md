# printf
- it returns the number of charaters it has printed
- null character not considered for the length
 ``` c
  int a = printf("hello");
```
- here a's value is <span style="font-size:2em;margin-left:.2em">6</span>
## adding a number in printf
 - ``` c
 printf(2+"hello");
  printf("hello"+2);
   ```
  - gives you this
   >llo world  
   >llo world  
    ### basically chops off the first letters
  -
  ``` c
  printf("hello");
  printf(-2+"hello");  
  ```
  - gives you this   
    >helloo  
    ### remember the null character is '\0' and -2th character is 'o'

  - also if nothing is printed before the first print it simply ignores the statement

  ``` c
    printf(-2+"hello");  
  ```
  - gives you this   
    >
    ### *as nothing is printed before and it*  
    **only targets the printed output so if some data is allocated in between it wont affect it**

  - #  you can write a program without `;` in C , use `if` condition and give nothing inside the braces

  # if

  -
  ``` c
    float a = 3.3;
    printf(a==3.3);
  ```
- yields `false` as 3.3 is stored as `double` but it is then stored as float in a.  
- but 3.3 on its own is double which is `8` in size but float is  `4` in size thats why   u get false;

-
```c
  float a = 3.3;
  printf((double)a==3.3);
  printf(a==(float)3.3);
```
- this gives `false` first and `true` later.
- reason being that while converting `a` to `double` data is lost , i.e 4 to 8 it fills it up with 0 which wont be equal to `3.3` which is already in double.
# shit goes sideways when you have multiple of .5 , they are still double but they have 0 in the rest of the places so

```c
  float a = 3.5;
  printf(a==3.5);
```
- yields `true`  
# int a = 010; it  makes `a` to hold an octal value.
- so when numbers start from 0 it makes it octal.
