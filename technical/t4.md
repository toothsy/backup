# logical and gate
``` c
int a=0,b=0,c;
c = a++&&b++;
printf("%d %d %d\n",a,b,c );
```
- > 1 0 0
- output is `100` and not `110` as once a is found to be 0 , no further code is executed .
- ##b is not incremented one bit.
- called as short circuiting

# similarly for `OR` if first value is true dont check the second

- note * / % have equal precedence
